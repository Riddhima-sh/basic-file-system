# Basic File System

A simple file system simulation in C++ designed to demonstrate the core concepts of how files and directories are managed in a typical operating system. This project is ideal for beginners learning about data structures, file handling, and operating system fundamentals.

## 🧠 Features

- Create files and folders
- Delete files and folders
- Display file structure in hierarchical format
- Basic command simulation (like mkdir, touch, ls)
- Memory management using blocks

## 📁 Project Structure

├── main.cpp             # Entry point of the application
├── file\_system.h        # Header file containing class definitions
├── file\_system.cpp      # Implementation of the file system logic
└── README.md            # Project documentation

## 🔧 Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
- C++11 or above

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
